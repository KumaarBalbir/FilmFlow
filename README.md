- **Search Movies:** Users can search for movies by title.
- **Autocompletion:** Auto suggest films title based on user input.
- **View Movie Details:** Detailed information about each movie, including posters, overview, ratings, genres, release date, and runtime, is displayed.
- **Similar Movie Recommendations:** Based on the selected movie, users can get recommendations for similar movies.
- **Explore Cast Details:** Users can explore details about the cast of a movie, including their birthdays, biographies, and place of birth.

- **API:** The Movie Database (TMDb) API

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/KumaarBalbir/FilmFlow.git`
2. Create a virtual environment using Conda: `conda create --name filmflow-venv python=3.8`
3. Activate the virtual environment: `conda activate filmflow-venv`
4. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run the Flask application: `python main.py`
6. Open the browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the application.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Main Flask application file containing route definitions and API integrations.
- `static/`: Contains static files such as CSS stylesheets and JavaScript scripts (`recommend.js`: JavaScript file for frontend functionality such as **AJAX requests** and event handling and `autocomplete.js` is for **autosuggestion** while user enters title name).
